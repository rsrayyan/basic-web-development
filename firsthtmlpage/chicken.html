    <p>The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated subspecies of the red junglefowl originally 
        from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and younger male may be 
        called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen 
        and a sexually immature female is called a pullet.

        Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until
        the Hellenistic period (4thâ€“2nd centuries BC).[1][2] Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of
         food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets.
